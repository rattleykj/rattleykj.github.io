        As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt deeply moved. and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <style>
            .highlight {
                background-color: orange;
            }
            </style>
            <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even. that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <style>
            .red-text {
                color: red;
            }
            </style>
            <span class="red-text">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..." </span>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <style>
            .red-text {
                color: red;
            }
            </style>
            <span class="red-text">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a lower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep ..."</span>
        And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt the need of protecting him. as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
